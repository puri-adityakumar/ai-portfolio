# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Portfolio Chatbot is a dual-interface portfolio website that provides visitors with two distinct ways to explore a professional's background. The system combines an AI-powered conversational interface with a traditional portfolio layout, allowing users to either chat naturally about the person's experience or browse information in a structured format. The solution prioritizes simplicity with zero backend complexity while maintaining professional presentation and interactive engagement.
